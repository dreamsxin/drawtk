Description: Library to simple and efficient 2D drawings
 This package provides an C library to perform efficient 2D drawings. The
 drawing is done by OpenGL which allow us fast and nice rendering of basic
 shapes, text and images (and more in future). It has been implemented as a
 thin layer that hides the complexity of the OpenGL library.
