.SH NAME
dtk_destroy_texture - Free a texture
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B #include <drawtk.h>
.sp
.BI "void dtk_destroy_texture(dtk_htex " tex ");"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This function frees the ressource associated with a texture \fItex\fP. If the
texture is used several times, i.e. several call to \fBdtk_load_image\fP() with
the same image path, it decreases the number of uses by one.
.LP
Calling \fBdtk_destroy_texture\fP() on each created texture is currently not
mandatory since all texture remaining textures are destroyed when the last
window is closed.  However, if no window can be closed (for example, no window
has been created), \fBdtk_destroy_texture\fP() should be called on each created
texture to avoid any memory leak.
.LP
\fBdtk_destroy_texture\fP() is thread-safe.
