.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This function changes the state (or playing position) of a video texture
referenced by \fIvid\fP according to the value of \fIcommand\fP:
\fBDTKV_CMD_PLAY\fP, \fBDTKV_CMD_PAUSE\fP, \fBDTKV_CMD_REWIND\fP.
\fIvid\fP must be a dynamic texture created by one of the functions 
\fBdtk_create_video_*\fP(3). If the video was already in the requested
state, the function will do nothing.
.LP
If the video is created from the live source (webcam, network broadcast...),
executing \fBDTKV_CMD_REWIND\fP will fail.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.LP
0 if the state has been changed or was already the one requested, -1 otherwise.
