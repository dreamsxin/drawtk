.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fBdtk_create_line\fP() creates a line between the points (\fIx1\fP,\fIy1\fP)
and (\fIx2\fP,\fIy2\fP).
.LP
\fIshp\fP and \fIcolor\fP have the same usage and meaning as for
other shape creation function:
.IP " *" 3
\fIshp\fP can be used to modify a previously created shape. If it is non-null,
the handle will be used to modify the shape referenced by \fIshp\fP: no new
shape is created and the returned value is ensured to be \fIshp\fP in case of
success, \fINULL\fP otherwise. If \fIshp\fP is \fINULL\fP, the function will
attempt to create a new shape.
.LP
.IP " *" 3
\fIcolor\fP should point to a 4 float array containing a normalized RGBA value
(i.e. each component is between 0.0 and 1.0).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.LP
In case of success these functions return the handle to the newly created or modified
shape. If the \fIshp\fP argument is non-null, the handle returned is the
same value. In case of error, \fINULL\fP is returned.
